# **Stats-220**
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## *A little about me*:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science(Statistics).
  
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in using R to deal with data science challenges like data importing, wrangling and visualizing for decision making. I hope this course can pave the way for Stats 369(which I will take the next semester), and data science-related jobs in the future.
  
- I am  interested in learning about:
 * data wrangling and visualizing, and how they help data-driven decision making;
 * tidy data principles, and how they will facilitate the efficiency of data work.

- Other interests:
- 1. learning about Web Technologies and Web Scraping
  2. gaining practical skills in HTML and CSS for web scraping
  3. get to know how I can use R to extract and process data from Web resources

### *A little more personal about me*:

- Apart from my studies and my love for data and technology, I am also interested in public policies, raising rabbits and
listening to music.

# Stats-220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science(Statistics).
- 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in using R to deal with data science challenges like data importing, wrangling and visualizing for decision making. I hope this course can pave
- the way for Stats 369(which I will take the next semester), and data science-related jobs in the future.
- 
- I am  interested in learning about data wrangling and visualizing, and how they help data-driven decision making. I also want to know about tidy data principles, and how they will
- facilitate the efficiency of data work. I am also interested in learning about Web Technologies and Web Scraping, gaining practical skills in HTML and CSS for web scraping, so I may get to know
- how I can use R to extract and process data from Web resources.

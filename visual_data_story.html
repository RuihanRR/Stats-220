<div class="figcaption">A bar chart that shows the proportion of focused
mood highest in early morning and early afternoon.</div>
</div>
<p>This visualization plot aims to analyze the relationship between the
time of the day and the proportion of focused study mood/study condition
among students.</p>
<p>To begin with, I was collecting data 3 times a day and categorized
the categorical variable <em>time_of_the_day</em> as Morning if the
Timestamp was between 8:00 - 11:00 a.m., Noon if the Timestamp was
between 11:30-14:30, and Late Afternoon if it was between 15:30 -18:30.
And during these observation periods, I observed students’ general
behaviors in level M and level 2 of the library, and categorized their
condition of studying as either focused, energetic, tired or distracted,
into a variable called <em>general_mood</em>. I was interested to find
out the relationship between the state of focus and the
<em>time_of_the_day</em>, so I calculated the focused situation grouped
by the <em>time_of_the_day</em>. I did this first by using
<strong>str_detect()</strong> to select the data points that were in
focused situation for the variable <em>general_mood</em>, and grouped
the data by <em>time_of_the_day</em> using function
<strong>group_by()</strong>. Then, I created a logical binary variable
called <em>is_focused</em> that counts TRUE if the situation is focused,
and FALSE otherwise.Furthermore, I <strong>summarized</strong> the mean
over this logical vector to count the proportion that it is TRUE(the
proportion of “focused”). Finally, I created the bar charts using
<strong>geom_col()</strong> to analyze the relationship between
<em>time_of_the day(x axis)</em> the <em>proportion_of_focused(y
axis)</em>.</p>
<p>The result was compelling. Firstly, the proportion of focused mood
was 100% in the morning, which was substantially higher than in all
other time periods.</p>
<p>This suggests that concentration levels peak earlier in the day,
possibly due to fewer distractions or the freshness of starting work
early.</p>
<p>By noon, the proportion of focused situation dropped to around 30%,
and by late afternoon, it was near 0.</p>
<p>This shows a clear downward trend in focus as the day progresses,
which may be due to fatigue, cognitive overload, or socializing and
multitasking.</p>

<div class="figcaption">A dot plot that shows group study ratio is
relatively low during the quietest time slots</div>
</div>
<p>This plot aims to observe whether there is a relationship between the
<em>group study ratio</em> and the <em>noise level</em> of the library,
and especially how the level of group study behaves under relatively
quiet environment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the level of quietness is measured by the noise level
from 1 to 5, and the smaller the number the quieter the environment.
Noticeably, this number combines both perceived feelings and objective
measurements. This is because some of my data(from March 31th to April
2nd) were recalled to incorporate the uniqueness of exam periods, which
may be of great importance for my analysis in the context of student
behaviors in the library. For these days, noise level was a subjective
ranking from 1(silent), 2(very quiet), 3(moderate) to 5(noisy and
distracting). For my actually recorded dates, my noise level was an
objective measurement of noise level in dBs using my iphone APP. I
categorized levels as 1(30-35 db), level2(36-45 dB), level 3(46-55 dB),
level 4(56-65 dB) and level 5(66-75 dB).</p>
<p>Then I used the <strong>arrange()</strong> function to sort the data
according to the noise level(from quiet to loud), and selected the top
12 most quiet data points using <strong>slice()</strong>. Afterwards I
used <strong>geom_point()</strong> to plot these top 12 quiet data
points with <em>timestamp</em> as x axis and the <em>group study
ratio</em> as the y axis, which is a clear and convenient way to see the
group study ratio for these “quiet” time points.</p>
<p>There are 2 main observations: 1)While group study was present during
the quietest time slots, the ratios remained generally ≤ 20%, which was
substantially lower than the overall observed range of group study ratio
(up to 70–80%).</p>
<p>This suggests that while students may still engage in collaborative
work in quiet environments, these interactions were likely smaller in
scale or more quiet in nature, rather than large, active group
sessions.</p>
<p>2)Group study ratios range from 0% to 20%, showing considerable
behavioral diversity even in similarly quiet settings. This suggests
that noise level itself did not predict how collaborative students were
— other factors may influence the extent of group interactions.</p>

alt="A scatter plot comparing noise level and stress signs: stress is higher in exam periods with increased noise." />
<div class="figcaption">A scatter plot comparing noise level and stress
signs: stress is higher in exam periods with increased noise.</div>
</div>
<p>This plot aims to analyze the relationship between
<em>noise_level</em> and <em>visible stress signs</em> with a focus to
distinguish between <em>exam and non-exam periods</em>. It is analyzing
whether students are more or less stressed when the noise levels are
different, and whether this pattern changes during exam or non-exam
periods.</p>
<p>To begin with, the variable <em>visible_stress_signs</em> is a
logical variable that counts Yes if I saw or recorded evident signs of
stress among students, like pacing, hair-scratching, head-holding and
intense typing, and no otherwise. And the exam_period variable is TRUE
for my recalled period of data(March 31 to April 2), and FALSE for any
collection afterwards that are actual records.</p>
<p>I plotted the <em>noise_level(x axis)</em> over the <em>visible
stress signs(y axis)</em>, with different <em>colors</em> using
<em>scale_colour_manual</em> to distinguish between exam and non-exam
periods. I plotted this using <strong>geom_jitter()</strong> so that I
can avoid overlapping of the dots, which is necessary here since the
variable of the y-axis only has 2 categories, and so it is easy for the
data points to stack together and cover up the pattern.</p>
<p>The two main findings are as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, visible stress signs were more frequent during exam
periods.Despite having fewer total exam-period observations (pink
points), a relatively larger proportion of them were at “Yes” for
Visible_Stress_Signs. This suggests that students were more visibly
stressed during exams.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if there was no deterministic relationship between
noise level and visible stress signs, students appeared more stressed
when the noise level was ≤ 4 (i.e., moderately quiet environments). A
possible explanation for this was the influence of a confounding
variable: Main Activities. Students in quieter environments were more
likely to be studying alone, while those in noisier environments might
be engaged in group studies or chatting, which were typically more
social, less stressful and less cognitively demanding.</p>
